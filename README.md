# üî¨ AML vs. ALL Gene Expression Classification Using Machine Learning

## üßæ What is AML and ALL?

**Leukemia** is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow ‚Äî the soft tissue inside bones where blood cells are made. Among the various types of leukemia, two major and dangerous subtypes are:

### ü©∏ Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
- AML is a **fast-growing** form of blood cancer that starts in the **myeloid cells**, which are responsible for producing red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
- In AML, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells that grow uncontrollably and interfere with the production of normal cells.
- AML is more common in **adults**, especially in older adults, but it can occur at any age.

### ü©∏ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
- ALL is another **fast-growing** blood cancer, but it starts in the **lymphoid cells**, which form a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes that help fight infection.
- ALL is the **most common type of cancer in children**, but it can also occur in adults.
- Like AML, ALL causes the bone marrow to produce a large number of immature, abnormal white blood cells.

### üòü Why Is This a Big Problem?
- AML and ALL are **life-threatening conditions** that require **immediate and specific treatment**.
- Despite both being leukemia, **they require entirely different treatments**. Giving the wrong treatment can lead to serious complications or even death.
- Traditional diagnosis requires **bone marrow biopsies, blood tests, genetic analysis, and expert interpretation**, which can be:
  - Time-consuming
  - Expensive
  - Prone to human error in complex cases
- Hence, accurate and early **classification of AML vs. ALL is absolutely critical** to saving lives.

## ‚ùó The Problem This Project Addresses

- Hospitals and labs increasingly collect **gene expression data** ‚Äî a snapshot of how active thousands of genes are in a patient‚Äôs cells.
- This data can help us distinguish between diseases like AML and ALL at a **molecular level**.
- But this data is extremely **large and complex** ‚Äî a single sample can contain over **7000 gene measurements**.
- It‚Äôs **impossible for doctors to manually analyze** this kind of data without help.

## ü§ñ Why Use AI/ML for Leukemia Classification?

Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically **Machine Learning (ML)**, can learn patterns from large datasets that are beyond human analysis. For leukemia classification, ML models:

- Learn from thousands of past patient samples
- Automatically discover the most important genes (features)
- Make accurate predictions for new patients
- Save time, cost, and reduce diagnostic errors
- Support doctors in making quicker, more informed decisions

This project applies ML techniques to **automatically classify whether a person has AML or ALL based on gene expression data**, using open-source datasets.

## üéØ Project Objective

To develop and compare machine learning models that can accurately classify whether a patient has **AML or ALL**, based on high-dimensional gene expression profiles.

## üì¶ Dataset

- **Source**: Publicly available dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/gene-expression)
- **Files Used**:
  - `data_set_ALL_AML_train.csv` ‚Äì Training samples
  - `data_set_ALL_AML_independent.csv` ‚Äì Independent test samples

Each row in the dataset represents the gene activity (expression) of a patient, with labels indicating whether the patient has AML or ALL.
